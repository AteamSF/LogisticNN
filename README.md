# Logistic Regression with Neural Network

Building a general architecture of learning algorithm which will include the following:

1. Initializing parameters
1. Calculating the cost function and its gradient
1. Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)

Code for this project is extracted from jupyter notebook. It might lack proper software engineering practices since it's not yet a fit for a direct drag and drop to a real life system. Feel free to submit an issue if you are looking forward to using it.
